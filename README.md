# Lunch Planner
organise your lunch break to socialize with friends and colleagues

# Getting Started
Our small group of computer science students are developing the Lunch Planner.
During the SEP (Software engineer project, length: 1 SEM), at the university of applied sciences mannheim.
We decided to advance our project from beeing a software, only in use by companies to beeing a
open source software, usable for all. We had the luck to work together with a high motivated 
company, that spent very much time supporting us and
encouraged us to take our creativity to the next level.

Have fun and find some new friends!

This source code will show you a REST-API, written in:

  - Java (Backend)
  - JS, HTML, CSS, LESS (Frontend)
  
  the Core-Features this Web-Application is based on, are:
  
    - subscribe to people, teams, events or locations
    - invite friends or colleagues to events
    - get a push notification from subscribers
    - write comments about locations or events
    - chat with friends
    
  additionally to the core-features are the advanced-features. They are divided up in:
  
    - order some food at chosen food delivery
    - rate events or locations
    - create private teams or events
    - integrate the lunch planner to your outlook
